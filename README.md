## Hey there, I'm Archit 👋

I'm an undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur working in the fields of Robotics, Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. In the past, and often when I find the time, I also work on software and backend development.

### Present

Currently I'm working on bridging OpenCV and Julia. This is my return to software development after a long break and I'm seriosuly enjoying the work aswell as community involvement in open source work. 

Apart from that I'm also working on some projects related to Aerial Robots and RL. Very excited about the things to come.

You can find more about me at [archit.me](https://archit.me/) but I'd rather prefer you just send me an email and I'd be happy to talk. ✌️ Peace out!
